        <h2>Subtheme: Exclusionary Zoning</h2>
        <h3>Dataset</h3>
        <p>
          This dataset is provided by the Metropolitan Area Planning Council
          (MAPC). It contains 2010 census information and geographical data
          regarding single family zoning and other types of housing zones in
          Metro Boston Municipalities; in addition to aggregate age, household
          size,and race data. This dataset has already filtered out non-housing
          zones, and combined zones according to whether is is only
          single-family zoning by munipalities. Included within this dataset is
          also 2014-2018 income data aggregated by zoning area into block
          groups. Given the many attributes contained in this dataset, I'm
          interested in exploring and understanding possibly inherent systemic
          qualities/patterns that contribute to or arise from the housing
          crisis.
        </p>

        <h3>Overall Analysis Questions</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <h4>
              What does the distribution of various housing zones compared to
              municipal populations?
            </h4>
            <p>
              <strong>Motivation:</strong>
              I want to understand the general landscape of housing within
              Massachusetts municipalities. In Badger and Bui's article
              <a href="#footnote-1">[1]</a>, we are able to get a rough idea of
              housing distribution based on visualization of states like New
              York and Georgia. A similar visualization would aid in our
              understanding of Massachusetts' housing zones. Exploring this
              question seems will aid in starting to understand the data, and
              build a background for the overall housing situation in the
              Massachusetts municipalities.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>
              How do different factors (ie. income, race, and age distribution)
              compare in single housing zones versus other housing zones?
            </h4>
            <p>
              <strong>Motivation:</strong>
              We have seen a historical pattern of various groups affected by
              systemic discrimination; in housing particularly, there have been
              instances of redlining (eg. Black and Latinos in South Bronx -
              1970s), and even modern biases within the mortagage approval
              process
              <a href="#footnote-2">[2]</a>. This motivates my question to
              understand whether similar patterns arise here whether as a cause
              or result of the housing crisis. It may also help us understand
              housing demands and other patterns.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>
              Compared to a municipal's population, how much land are single
              family homes taking up and how many people are they actually
              housing?
            </h4>
            <p>
              <strong>Motivation:</strong>
              From the background readings<a href="#footnote-2">[2]</a
              ><a href="#footnote-3">[3]</a>, we learned that single family
              homes take up quite a lot of space and even converting a small
              percentange of single-family homes could create a many new homes
              for people who need it. This motivated me to pose this question to
              understand how much space is being occupied, the population of
              people that need housing to potentially predict how many more
              people could be housed. Furthermore, I believe I read somewhere
              that many of these single-family homes are only occupied by 1-2
              older individuals (more expensive to maintain). From personal
              experience, younger individuals tend to move into apartments or
              more long-short term housing. Insights from the previous question
              should help us understand what the exact needs are and if we could
              potentially meet them via upzoning.

          <!-- <li>
            <h4>How has housing zoning changed across time?</h4>
            <p>
              <strong>Motivation:</strong>
              From the background reading <a href="#footnote-2">[2]</a>, we
              learn that it wasn't always single-family zones everywhere (only
              became designed around a century ago). Thus, it would be
              interesting to learn exactly how housing has changed (eg. zones
              have been establsihed) in correlation to historical or modern
              events. It'd be interesting to see if any policy changes occured
              and how that affected housing in certain areas.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>
              What does ownership status (ie. homeowner, renter) look like
              across different zoning and municipalities?
            </h4>
            <p>
              <strong>Motivation:</strong>
              From lecture, we noted the increasing speculation and "flipping"
              of properties as investment, which drives up housing prices and
              lowers supply for actual residents. I'm not sure if this dataset
              will be able to fully reveal this pattern, based upon the
              metadata; however I think it is worth exploring to further
              understand the landscape of housing ownership.

        <h2>Discoveries & Insights</h2>

              This graph compares the number of households across all municipalities with each bar colored based on whether the municipal is an only single-family zone, other, or has a combination of both. 
              Furthermore, the line graph follows the overall population in each municipality.
              <ul>
                <li>
                  This graph was a good sanity check that the number of households correlated with the population in each municipal. The only interesting inconsistency was with Lynn and Neton, where there appeared to be a large jump in the graph. This will be interesting to explore given more data on how much land is actually taken up for single-family housing relative to overall land size. At this current moment, we only have what percent of land out of all home which is not very useful because Lynn and Newton are both only-single family zones.
                </li>
                <li>
                  It makes sense that many municipalities are not just single-family zones or not (very binary). However, for these zones that are only one or the other, it'll be interesting to explore how various factors like race/ethnicity, income, household size affect who lives in which zones.
                </li>
                <li>
                  As hypothesized, only-single family zones have the lower end of populations. I wonder how much land and area they are relative to other munipalities, or whether it is simply from housing or other factors (which may require more data).
                </li>
              </ul>
              <strong>Note:</strong>
              Removed Boston and Cambridge, both of which are not single housing
              zones, in order to better understand the variance of remaining
              municipalities.

            These pie charts breaks down the age ranges given whether the zone is a only-single family or other.
            <ul>
              <li>
                Zones that are not single-family housing have 2x more people than zones that are only single family. However, we should probably explore the number of building (require more data) relative to number of households to better understand how much more significantly multi-family homes contribute to overall housing population.

            <ul>
              <li>
                There is significantly more Hispanic and Latino families in munipalities that are not only-single family. It is worth exploring the correlation between race/ethnicity against household size given the large variance in data between population sizes.             
              </li>
            </ul>
            <strong>Note:</strong>
            Removed Non-Hispanic White Population because they dominated in both zones and I wanted to further highlight variance in remaining data.

          <figcaption>This graph breaks down housing size between non-family vs family households as well as different housing sizes across zones that are only-single family and not.
            <ul>
              <li>
                There is significantly more non-family household relative to family households in zones that were not single-family only. It would be interesting to further explore how incompare compares between family and non-family households.
              </li>
              <li>
                  The pie charts for overall household size demonstrate overall structure in each housing zone, however, it'd be interesting to further visualize how the numbers look like relative to eachother as currently, the ratios look relatively the same.

            <ul>
              <li>
                As hypothesized, those with significantly higher incomes were more likely to lve in only-singly family zones (making up more than 67% of the population). It's interesting to see the much greater spread (almost more "evenly distributed") income breakdown for households living in other housing zones.

        <h2>Summary</h2>

        <p>Overall, I was able to confirm most of my initial hypothesis through this data exploratory analysis. However, there is definitely more visualization to be done to understand the data which could also be aided through more data about each specific municipal.</p>
